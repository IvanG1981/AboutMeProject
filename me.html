    <h2>I'm Ivan Gonzalez</h2>
    <p>Born in Bogota, <strong>Colombia</strong> 37 years ago, graduated as an Electronic engineer, but instead of finding a job in my field of study,
      life put me in a path working 12 years as a field engineer in the Oil & Gas industry; this path took me to every continent, from working in the jungle,
      to the desert, and from cold places to spent weeks at a time in the middle of the persian gulf. In 2015 I met my current wife (amazingly through a dating app)
      and I started to think about a radical career change, for something that gave more time for myself and building a family, and at the same time allowed
      me to explore my creativity, and enjoy it in the process. That's how this path lead me to coding once again since the university and to
      Bogota Dev Bootcamp.
      <h3>and a little more about me...</h3><p>I'm a person who likes to spent time with nature, love animals (we have two cats and a dog), I enjoy traveling, explore new places, meet people and learn
      from different cultures and also, its very important for me to share quality time with my family. I do workout everyother day, and I play football, but not as
      regularly a I would like to (and as I used to). </p>
